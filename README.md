Project realized with [Théotime Lameyre](https://github.com/tlameyre) for the course "Back-end & Front-end Development" at the University Paris-Dauphine, Master MIAGE. 

Sport**Buddy** is an application that lets you create a sport event. It lists the places of activities in Paris for the following sports: Soccer, Basketball, Tennis and running. You just have to select the sport, the place and the date to create an event. You can also browse the next events to come, according to the activity or the district
The goal is not to do sports alone and to meet people with the same interests!
