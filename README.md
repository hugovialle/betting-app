Project realized with [Th√©otime Lameyre](https://github.com/tlameyre) for the course "Back-end & Front-end Development" at Paris-Dauphine University, Master MIAGE. 

Sport**Buddy** is an application that lets you create a sport event. It lists the places of activities in Paris for the following sports: Soccer, Basketball, Tennis and running. You just have to select the sport, the place and the date to create an event. You can also browse the next events to come, according to the activity or the district
